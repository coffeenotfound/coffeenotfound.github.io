title: "The StackOverflow-Gestapo"
---

StackOverflow is probably the biggest programming related Q&A site on the internet
right now, and has been for many years.
Chances are that if you have ever had any programming related question,
you probably found many answers on a very similar question or even the exact same question.
It seems, though, as if it's fame is deceiving and hiding what
is actually a decline into full on Gestapo madness.

If you haven't already guessed, this post is more of a rant on the rampant "SO-Nazi" culture
present on not only StackOverflow, but all of it's derivates, too. As if it was not already bad
enough, the site is also not designed in a sensical way, meaning that not only are new users disliked,
the site actively cripples their chances to gain reputation in the first place.


### "__Git out__"

StackOverflow is the wild, wild West, baby! And unless your name is [John __'Effing__ Skeet](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet)
you gotta earn that respect. It certainly won't come _your_ way.
That is my biggest problem with StackOverflow: _The StackOverflow Nazis_
Ever wanted to get even the tiniest flaw in your question pointed out while the question _itself_ is ignored?
Welcome to StackOverflow.

I have to confess... I'm still a "new comer" on StackOverflow and the be honest, that is not that surprising
after what people looking for some advice or wanting to be helpful have to go through.
Just a few hours ago I asked whether C/C++ code would run anywhere given the right runtime libraries.
See any major problems with this question? Because the SO-Gestapo certainly did. Many, many problems.

To be fair it is not the best question so the first downvote was cast and comments started rolling in.
Just wanting to have asked a good question I changed the question to specify that I meant a compiled
C/C++ executable and I was immediately faced with this comment:

`
you're missing the point...there is no such thing as C++/C (or C/C++) and some of us at the c++ tag try to correct this misconception. As a practical matter, C and C++ are likely to have very different runtime/library/etc. requirements for any non-trivial program.
`

Slowly getting the vibe that he just wants to point out that C++ is so much different than C (that's why C++ compilers also come with C compilers, but whatever)
instead of answering the question? I mean he tried with the last sentence but that has nothing to do with my question, really. It didn't stop there, though.
Apparently I broke some kind of unwritten rule that StackOverflow noobs may not ask non trivial questions:

`
if you're "new to C++" (your words) then why are you even __asking__ about something like this? You are not going to be writing code for Windows 95 or an Apple ][ anytime soon ...
`

Geez, sorry to ask. I was just curious. Luckily there was one kind soul who had a bit of mercy:

`
To be fair, your question is a reasonable one, if you are asking if you can take a compiled program without "dependencies" from one x86 platform to another. It isn't necessarily obvious that you can't, and indeed in the past some minimal type of interop like this was possible between different platforms. You might want to make the focus of your question the idea of a compiled binary, and use only C and C++ as examples of how such a binary might be generated, to skirt the wrath of the langauge lawyers who'll tell you this isn't defined in the standard, etc, etc.
`

It is funny how he even pointed out the "language lawyers". Why do I say that? Because the answer with the most upvotes (even after getting a downvote
from me for not _actually_ answering the question) explains how "this isn't specified by C++ itself".
After many edits to my question and virtually removing any mention of C++ the my question still has 2 downvotest despite being, in my opinion,
fairly interesting, especially for Java devs who do not have to worry about such things.

It really seems like people are not that interested in answering questions and more in pointing out what is wrong with them.
It certainly feels like that when the first interactions are downvotes and comments about how bad the question is.
And they _will_ point out everything. Even if it is still an interesting question, if it is deemed "off-topic", "opinion based",
or any other description, the question is closed or outright deleted.
I would love to know why people have become so mean on this otherwise very helpful Q&A site. In fact it has become extremely
uncomfortable to the point that I don't feel like I want to ask anything anymore. Why should I when most of the users are
actively ignoring the question and even if they don't the answers mostly miss the point.

Like a group of bitter lions luring on an innocent antelope just to strike and rip it to pieces.


### Systemic Problems

Okay, the community is bad, but the site is pretty good otherwise, right?
Well, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news but the site really is not welcoming to
new comers from a design standpoint, either.

As a start, you better have excellent knowledge about a topic to be able to answer a question because you have to
earn the priviledge to _comment on posts_. As you start with 1 single reputation point only, you either have to choice
to perfectly answer a question ("perfectly" as in "to avoid feeling the wrath of guideline warriors") or not answering at all.
In fact many features are locked away until you have enough reputation points, in order to prevent spammers or trolls to ruin a conversation
but don't worry, the normal community has that covered just fine.

One big problem, that I have already pointed out is that people rather want to correct your question instead of answering it.
My thesis is that people don't want to give long, elaborate answers, or any answers at all because they do not want to
be beaten to the punch by ten other answers. Maybe it is just projection, but I don't feel like I should even consider answering
because the questions that I actually _could_ answer insightfully have, or will if it is a new question, be answered by people with tens of thouands
of reputations points that put out way better answers than I could anyway, probably even faster than me.
So instead of even trying, users try to find a quick flaw they can point out so to not have contributed nothing to the question,
eventhough that is not very helpful.


### Conclusion

Back when I first signed up to StackOverflow I had this dream in my head that it will be wonderful.
Asking question, sharing my knowledge, gaining reputation points. Nowadays I do not have any urge to
interact with the community anymore. It is full of people trying to pick apart your question while feeling
they are better than you just because they have a few more virtual reputation points while they ignore
answering your question.

If I want to hear some snarky commments I can watch Gordon Ramsay, thank you very much.
